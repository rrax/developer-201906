## Instructions

Your goal is to release version 0.2.0 of this repository. The repository contains 3 assignments, each in a separate feature branch.

What you should do:

- Read these instructions carefully
- Fork this repository
- For each assignment in order:
  - Read the assignment info in README.md in detail
  - Complete assignment (or try your best)
  - Commit your results and finish the corresponding feature
- When you've completed all features, you can release version 0.2.0.
- When ready, share the repository with @anttikuuskoski and send an email to antti@emmy.fi for timestamping the event.

Also note:

- Do not panic, this is not a school test
- Asking help is always allowed
- If something does not make sense, it probably doesn't
- For function signatures, see for example [this hackernoon article](https://hackernoon.com/function-type-signatures-in-javascript-5c698c1e9801). Object signatures are home grown, but you should be fine.
