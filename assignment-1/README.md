# Assignment 1

An unnamed developer has created a [Piece Of Code](code.js) before leaving the team. The piece of code has landed on your desk while you were in progress refactoring code en route to a new feature.

## Questions

1. Analyze the code and give your (detailed) expert opinion below on whether this is "good code"?

2. Modify the file in any way you want so that it's contents fulfill your personal quality guidelines. I.e. "make it good".

## Answer to Q1

### First impressions

There seems to be happening a lot in this code. However the code is not very verbose so it is hard to comprehend what this is all about.

The code should be refactored into smaller functions and they should be named aptly describing what we achieve with the function in question. This way the main function would consist of readable words and it could possibly be understood even without deep knowledge of the programming language and possibly without any coments.

There is also some duplicate code which could be avoided this way. As a bonus we might get some functions reusable elsewhere in the codebase. Function signatures could be added to give more information about the functions.
